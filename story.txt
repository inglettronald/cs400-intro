Jeremy knew that he would go pro in Rocket League. He had been playing for 3 months now, and thoroughly enjoyed ever hour in game thus far. His mom wasn't happy with him because
his grades were slipping, but Jeremy knew it was only a matter of time until he was picked up by a team. Every day when Jeremy came home from school, he ran to his room,
turned on his pc, and got ready to game. Slurping down some g-fuel, he hopped into his discord call and messaged his diamond 2 friend. He had high hopes of being able to queue
competitive with him this time. He knew that he deserved to be at *least* diamond, but his teamates were just holding him back. He had the mechanics of a champ 2, but improving
proved to be hard when his teamates couldn't save a single shot.

All of a sudden, Jeremy heard his door swing open. His mom stood in the doorway, furious. Jeremy was confused. He didn't know what he did wrong, but his mom was
steaming with anger. Jeremy didn't want to say anything else to make her more mad. He softly asked, "What's wrong mom?" And then he realized, he didn't put the 
leftover chicken away. Jeremy's mom replied, "Come on out to the kitchen and see what you have done." Jeremy hesitantly got up and followed her out of his room.
When he got to the kitchen, Jeremy was in shock at what he saw.

As Jeremy was walking down the stairs towards the kitchen, he noticed a trail of tiny white specks leading into the kitchen. They were chewed up chicken bones. At first Jeremy
was confused at the sight, he stopped halfway down the stairs. "I didn't do that!" he exclaimed. His mom turned around and gave him a stern look. "Come see" she said. Jeremy got
to the entrace of the kitchen and froze in shock. A shatterred plate was on the floor and remains of chicken were scatterred all about. It each bone was chewed into dozens crude
pieces. Finally Jeremy saw the culprit of this murder scene. In the corner of the room sat his dog, chewing on the last bits of leftover chicken.
