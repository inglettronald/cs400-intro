Jeremy knew that he would go pro in Rocket League. He had been playing for 3 months now, and thoroughly enjoyed ever hour in game thus far. His mom wasn't happy with him because
his grades were slipping, but Jeremy knew it was only a matter of time until he was picked up by a team. Every day when Jeremy came home from school, he ran to his room,
turned on his pc, and got ready to game. Slurping down some g-fuel, he hopped into his discord call and messaged his diamond 2 friend. He had high hopes of being able to queue
competitive with him this time. He knew that he deserved to be at *least* diamond, but his teamates were just holding him back. He had the mechanics of a champ 2, but improving
proved to be hard when his teamates couldn't save a single shot.
